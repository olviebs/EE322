# Hello friends welcome to my GitHub for EE 322 
## I have not used GitHub very much before, but I'm *very* excited to learn!

**infact**, I'm learning so much already! Look at this! I made an ordered list. I'm going to be ranking the  majors at Stevens

1. Electrical Engineering
2. Computer Engineering
3. No other majors matter and EE is better than CPE

 now, I'm going to type out my grocery list here for **safe keeping**
- avacados
- bananas
- baking soda
- vinegar (im making a volcano)
- soup

  **furthermore**, here's some code

  `System.out.println("hello! Wats good gang");`

  *perchance* you'd like to see more,

Finally, here I'd like to share something that is near and dear to my heart. Redshift is the Stevens Creative Media Publication. I help run this organization, and our work can be accessed here!
