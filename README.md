# Hello friends welcome to my GitHub for EE 322 
## I have not used GitHub very much before, but I'm *very* excited to learn!

**infact**, I'm learning so much already! Look at this! I made an ordered list. I'm going to be ranking the  majors at Stevens

1. Electrical Engineering
2. Computer Engineering
3. No other majors matter and EE is better than CPE

 now, I'm going to type out my grocery list here for **safe keeping**
- avacados
- bananas
- baking soda
- vinegar (im making a volcano)
- soup

  **furthermore**, here's some code

  `System.out.println("hello! Wats good gang");`

  > Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
            Only this and nothing more.”

    > Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
    Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
    From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
            Nameless here for evermore.

   > And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
    So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
    “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—
            This it is and nothing more.”

Here's a picture of someone who constantly inspires me to be the best version of myself, his name is

# Jerma985 :D

Finally, here I'd like to share something that is near and dear to my heart. Redshift is the Stevens Creative Media Publication. I help run this organization, and our work can be accessed here!
