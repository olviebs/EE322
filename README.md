# Hello friends welcome to my GitHub for EE 322 
## I have not used GitHub very much before, but I'm *very* excited to learn!

#**infact**, I'm learning so much already! Look at this! I made an ordered list. I'm going to be ranking the  majors at Stevens

1. Electrical Engineering
2. Computer Engineering
3. No other majors matter and EE is better than CPE

#now, I'm going to type out my grocery list here for safe keeping
- avacados
- bananas
- baking soda
- vinegar (im making a volcano)
- soup
